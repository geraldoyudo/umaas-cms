UMAAS is a service that takes all the hassle of user managment from the developer.
With this service, a developer can have a central point for storing  user information,
relate with users, and perform routine activities like role assignment, group assignment,
sending mails, and so on.

== Registration
We are currently in the testing phase of UMAAS. This means that we will have
to grant you access to your account once you have registered.

Head on to {umaas-website}[UMAAS Website] click on "Sign UP" on the top right corner. Follow the
registration steps and an account will be created for you. You will get an email
stating that your registration is successful and pending approval.

Once we have approved your account, you can now log {umaas-website}/login[here]

== Domains
Domains are the unit of user management in UMAAS. All applications have a user
base and this user information is stored in a domain. You can have multiple domains
for multiple accounts, this ensures that a user must register on each of your applications.
You can also choose to have one domain for multiple applications which will save your
users the stress of registering for each of your applications.

=== Creating a Domain
To get started with creating a user-base for your application, click on My Account
and Domains to take you to the Domains page.

Head on to the domains page and click the add button on the bottom left of the
page.

.Adding Domains

Once you click the add button, a domain form dialog pops up. Just enter the name
and code for your domain.

NOTE: Domain names are human friendly names. It is advised to keep your domain
names name-spaced to avoid naming conflicts. For example com.example.todo for a
TODO application.

NOTE: Domain codes on the other hand are not friendly and can be auto generated. These
codes can be used to access the umaas flows and administration applicaiton. You can
auto-generate a new code to generate new links like that for registration.

Once that is done, click "Create Domain" and your domain is created!! You will
be able to view the newly created domain on the domain page-name

On each domain, a "MANAGE" and "REGISTER USER" button exists to enable the
domain administrator access the domain administration page and perform registration
flows.

=== Managing Domains
Domain administration is performed using the UMAAS domain administrator UI. It
enables the domain administrator to add users, groups and roles; group users; and
assign roles to users and groups.

In addition to these, the behaviour of the domain can be changed by modifying properties
in the settings and configuration sections.

On the domain page, click on "Manage Domains". You will be redirected to
the domain administration page. In the video below, we will create to groups: admin and regular,
and two roles: admin and normal. The admin group will be assigned the admin role and
the "regular" group will be assigned the admin role. We will also create 3 Users:
one admin and two regular.

== Access Codes
Access codes are the gateway to accessing domains or the domain administrator. An access
code is made up of an ID and a CODE. The ID is fixed while the CODE can be changed.
In order to access the UMAAS API, you need do add the access code information on the
header as specified.

Access Codes grant you access to one or more domains. This way, you can give a third party
your codes and be confident that he/she will only access the required domain. And if you
change your mind, you can revoke access to that domain with the access code.

=== Creating an Access Code
To create an access code for your domain, click on "My Accounts" and then "Access Codes"

Let us add the domain we created to this access code so that we can be able to access
the domain with our access code. Click on the drop down on the Domains column and add
the domain. Once this is done, click on "UPDATE". You will now be able to access
this domain with this access code.
