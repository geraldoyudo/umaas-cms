Springboot offers a lot of resources and libraries to help develop complex
software. It leverages core concepts of dependency injection and separation
of concerns. With springboot you can focus on letting your app do what is
is supposed to do and nothing more. In this tutorial, we are going showcase
how easy it is to integrate UMAAS with a springboot application.

== Requirements
This tutorial was done using the following:

* Windows 10 PC
* Spring boot 4.2
* Java 8
* Spring Tool Suite
* And of course, a UMAAS account!

== Creating your UMAAS Account
This step is the easiest, just head on to the link:../getting-started-with-umaas[Getting Started With UMAAS]
for details.

In this tutorial, we will work with the following:

* Two Groups: "admin" and "regular"
* Two Roles: "admin" and "normal"
* The "admin" group will have the "admin" role
* The "regular" group will have the "normal" role
* We will create three users: admin, user-1 and user-2 each with the password "aaaa"
* The admin user will be assigned to the admin group, while user-1 and user-2
  to the normal group.

== The Hello UMAAS Application
In this tutorial, we will be making a simple application that comprises of
4 pages:

* A welcome page that is accessible to all users, registered or not
* A home page that is accessible to all registered users
* A "Regular" page that is accessible to only registered users that belong to
  the "regular" group
* An "Admin" page that is accessible to only registered users that belong to
  the admin group

== The UMAAS Spring Boot Starter
The UMAAS spring boot starter is the best way to start integration of UMAAS with
 springboot. It comes with the following:

* A custom authentication and user details service that integrates with UMAAS
* An AppUser class that represents the User Object
* A pre-configured Security Configuration class with basic security configuration.
* Controllers for Login and Register
* A properties file for adding application specific properties.

=== Exploring the UMAAS Spring Boot Starter
The source code of the project is a maven project that can help you get started.
Do not worry if you are using gradle or a different version of spring boot. In this case,
just change the relevant aspects of the code, or better yet, create a new project with
your favorite IDE and environment, copy the source codes to your new project.

.UMAAS Spring Boot Starter Directory Structure

The springboot starter comprises of the following:

AppStarterSpringbootApplication.java:: The SpringBootApplication class
HomeController.java:: A Controller for the pages we are going to create
SecurityConfig.java:: Contains basic spring security configuration with our
custom user details service and authentication.
AppAuthenticationProvider.java:: Contains implementation for the Authentication
and UserDetails service.
AppUser.java:: The POJO class for a user Object
LoginController.java:: Provides the registration and login pages
static:: A folder for adding static files like .css, .js and image files.
templates:: This project uses Thymeleaf for rendering views, so we store our
templates here.
application.properties:: A properties file for adding app specific properties.

=== Customizing the UMAAS Spring Boot Starter

Assuming you are using the starter directly, you need to perform the following:

1. Rename the project by changing the name of the folder and modifying the pom.xml
2. Renaming the packages
3. Replace place holders in application.properties to the app specific values.


==== Renaming the project

Since we are creating a Hello UMAAS project, we need to rename it as such,
including its packages. We do the same for the pom.xml. Here's a sample.

[source, xml]
----
  ...
  ...
	<groupId>com.gerald.umaas.example</groupId>
	<artifactId>hello-umaas-spring-boot</artifactId>
	<version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
	<packaging>jar</packaging>

	<name>hello-umaas</name>
	<description>Simple UMAAS Starter Example</description>
  ...
  ...
----

The new directory structure becomes:

[[umaas-starter-directory-structure]]
.New UMAAS Spring Boot Starter Directory Structure
image::spring-boot-starter-directory-structure-new.png[New UMAAS Starter Directory Structure]

==== Applying App Specific Values

Here, we modify the application.properties and set the following:
1. replace [access-code-id] with the access code ID of the access code
linked to  this domain.
2. replace [access-code] with the access code value
3. replace [domain-id] with the ID of your domain
4. replace [domain-name] with the name of your domain

The new values is shown here:
[source, properties]
----
...
umaas.core=http://test.isslserv.com:8070/umaas-core
umaas.manager.access.id=584aaa6887e76bf7acf59675
umaas.manager.access.code=8329473843we8uqi98324328794323
umaas.manager.domain.id=584a9b5387e76bf7acf59668
umaas.registrationUrl=http://test.isslserv.com:8070/umaas-registration/app/register?domain=com.example.todo
...
----

=== Creating the Pages

As our requirement states, we need four pages. We add the pages to the HomeController.java. The
class contains some default pages. All we need to do is modify them and add more if necessary.

The HomeController.java now becomes

.HomeController.java
[source, java]
----
...
@Controller
public class HomeController {

	@GetMapping("/")
	public String index(){
		return "index";
	}
	@GetMapping("/home")
	public String home(){
		return "home";
	}
	@GetMapping("/admin")
	public String admin(){
		return "admin";
	}
	@GetMapping("/regular")
	public String regular(){
		return "regular";
	}

}
...
----

Once this is done, we now add (or edit) the pages in the template folder to
correspond to the four pages ("index", "home", "admin" and "regular"). If all is
done successfully, we should have the following in our templates folder:

* admin.html
* home.html
* index.html
* login.html
* regular.html

Don't forget to add content to the pages!

NOTE: Do not remove the login.html page. This page is the login page used for
the application!!

=== Securing the pages

Here, we modify the SecurityConfig.java to apply the restrictions we desire.
The resulting configuration is shown below.

.SecurityConfig.java
[source, java]
----
...
@Configuration
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter{
	@Autowired
	private AppAuthenticationProvider provider;
	private static final String APP_KEY = "helloUMAAS";
	@Override
	protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
		  http
          .authorizeRequests()
          .antMatchers("/home/**")
          .authenticated()
          .antMatchers("/regular/**")
          .hasAnyRole("NORMAL")
          .antMatchers("/admin/**")
          .hasAnyRole("ADMIN")
          .anyRequest().permitAll()
          .and()
          .formLogin()
          .loginPage("/login")
          .permitAll()
          .and()
          .httpBasic()
          .and()
          .logout()
          .logoutSuccessUrl("/login")
          .and()
          .rememberMe()
          .tokenValiditySeconds(30)
          .key(APP_KEY);
	}
  ...
  ...
}
...
----

Here, we changed the APP_KEY to "helloUMAAS" to avoid conflict with other
remember-me tokens from other applications. The astute reader will note that
the roles are written in capital letter while we saved the roles in small letters.
A snippet of the AppAuthenticationProvider is shown below:

[source, java]
----
...

private Collection<? extends GrantedAuthority> getAuthorities(List<String> roles) {
		return roles.stream()
				.map((r) ->{ return new SimpleGrantedAuthority("ROLE_" + r.toUpperCase());} )
				.collect(Collectors.toList());
	}

...
----

The "r.toUpperCase()" converts all roles to uppercase and makes it possible for us
to refer to our roles using only uppercase.

=== Running the application

If you are using STS, just right click on the project name on the Boot Dashboard and
click (Re)Start. Try login in with the users admin, user-1 and user-2 (all with "aaaa"
as the password). You have successfully integrated UMAAS with your spring boot application!!
